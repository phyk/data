```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = "~/StudDocs/Master/SS2019/Programming Data Science/data")
```

## Get the data 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
dataframe <- read_csv("./00_raw_data/order_data.csv", col_names = FALSE)
dataframe
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
